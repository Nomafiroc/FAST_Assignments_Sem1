Q1) An egg distribution company uses different sizes of packings for eggs, that is, 30 eggs
    packing, 24 eggs packing, 18 eggs packing, 12 eggs packing and 6 eggs packing. Write a program which
    prompts user to enter total number of eggs to be packed and then calculate how many packings of
    each size will be possible. Also tell if there will be any eggs left to be packed.
    
Q2) Write a C++ program to implement the following algebraic expressions to calculate and
    display the values of a,z,y,g,c. Other variables in the program will be input by the user:
    
    a = 12x
    z = 5x+14y+6k
    y = x^4
    g = (h+12)/4k
    c=(a^3)/(b^2)(k^4)
    
Q3) Write a program which asks user to enter a 5-digit number. Your program should then
    reverse the order of digits and make a new number such that each digit of the new number is half of
    the reversed digit (use only integer division). For example, 87549 will be reversed to 94578 and then
    each digit is halved i.e. 9->4, 4->2, 5->2, 7->3, 8->4. Same run of this input is shown below:
    
    Enter a 5-digit number: 87549
    Modified number: 43224
    
 Q4) Write a program which asks user to enter a word of any 8 random letters in small case.
    The program then converts the word in capital case and displays the new word. Hint: use cin.get()
    function so that you donâ€™t need to press ENTER every time (your program run should be similar to the
    sample run below). Use ASCII table to find out how small letter can be changed to capital letter. You
    cannot use string or arrays. Only use character variables.
    
    Enter an 8 letter word: mudasssar
    Your entered word in capital case is MUDASSAR
    
Q5) 5: Write a program that takes five integer numbers (range 0 to 10). And display horizontal
    bar chart. Also get scale input from the user to scale the bars size accordingly. For example, if N2 is 5
    and scale is 2 then the bar will be of 5x2=10 asterisks. Do not use loops. You can use <iomanip>
    header file for printing bar chat.
 
    Input Five integer numbers:
    N1=1
    N2=5
    N3=9
    N4=0
    N5=2
    Enter Scale: 2
    BAR CHART OUTPUT

Q6) You are required to write a program for a Point-of-Sale cash counter. Suppose a customer
    buys 5 items from the shop; your program should be able to get price of each item as data entry. The
    program should then create an invoice which shows the price of each item, sales tax on that item and
    total price of that item after adding tax. Finally, a total payable amount should be printed, with and
    without, sales tax. Sales Tax rate is 17%. Price and Total Price must always be displayed with accuracy
    of 2 decimal points whereas Sales Tax should be displayed with precision of 3 decimal points.
    Furthermore, all amounts should be right aligned.
  
    Price of item 1 = $15.95
    Price of item 2 = $24.95
    Price of item 3 = $6.95
    Price of item 4 = $12.95
    Price of item 5 = $3.95
    *****************************************************************
    ITEM PRICE SALES TAX (@17%) TOTAL PRICE
    1 15.95 2.712 18.66
    2 12.00 2.040 14.04
    3 52.60 8.942 61.54
    4 13.40 2.278 15.68
    5 0.70 0.119 0.82
    Total 94.65 16.091 110.74
Q7) To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up and then divide the sum by
    the number of values. Write a program that asks user to enter five values and show sum and average.
    Your program should not have more than 2 variables, one for getting user input and other for keeping
    the sum.
  
Q8) The courses of first two semesters of a BS Cybersecurity student in FAST are shown below.
    Write a program to get marks of a student in each of these subjects and calculate his/her semester
    GPA (SGPA) and Cumulative GPA (CGPA). Your program should also get student name, registration
    number and section to show in the detailed transcript. Transcript should be displayed semester-wise.
    Note that subject names and their credit hours are constants.
